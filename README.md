# icub-models-generator

Resources and programs to generate models (URDF, SDF) of the iCub robot.
The models automatically generated by the software and the resources in this repository
are available at https://github.com/robotology/icub-models .

**Note: this repository is meant to streamline the process of producing iCub URDF/SDF models by iCub mantainers. It is not meant to be used directly by users of iCub. For offical info on the kinematic parameters of the iCub, please see [the documentation in iCub's documentation](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/icub_kinematics/icub-forward-kinematics/icub-forward-kinematics/).**

## Dependencies
- [iDynTree](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree)
- [YARP](https://github.com/robotology/yarp)
- [simmechanics-to-urdf](https://github.com/robotology/simmechanics-to-urdf)

Detailed documentation on how to install the softare is current work in progress. In the meanwhile, you can check the exact way in which the software is installing by inspecting the [`CI` GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) that is used to automatically generate the models of iCub using this repo and commit it to the [icub-models](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models) repo.


## Usage
To generate the models, please ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies.
To update the content of a local `icub-models` repository, set in the `ICUB_MODELS_SOURCE_DIR`
CMake variable the absolute path to your `icub-models` repository, and execute the `copy-models-to-icub-models` target.

## Pipelines
Currently, it is possible to generate iCub models by means of two different pipelines.

1) The generation is achieved by using Denavit Hartenberg parametsrs based on robot-model hardcoded data in the iKin/iDyn source code, and meshes postprocessed by ISIR at UPMC, Paris, available in `dh` directory.

2) The generation is achieved from CAD models converted to simmechanics file, as described in https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/cad-mechanics-public/wiki/Creo-mechanism-to-URDF, available in the `simmechanics` directory.

As the two pipeline process data from different sources, **the link frames are not guaranteed to have the same orientation
or location across different models**. The only frames (that are represented in URDF as massless links) whose position is guaranteed to be consistent across different models are the one documented in https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/icub_kinematics/icub-model-naming-conventions/icub-model-naming-conventions/ .

Both generation pipelines are still in `a work in progress` state, and several issues need to be properly solved, e.g.:
* [Meshes are not properly handled #28](https://github.com/robotology/icub-model-generator/issues/28)
* [Hands and eyes are not generated #29](https://github.com/robotology/icub-model-generator/issues/29)
